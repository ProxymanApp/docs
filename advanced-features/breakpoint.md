  including the Headers, URL, Status Code, and the body

# Breakpoint

### 1. What's it?

Breakpoint is a handy tool to help developers to edit the content of the Request and Response **on the fly**.

It's possible to set a breakpoint on both **Request** or **Response.**

If you're using [Atlantis Framework](../atlantis/atlantis-for-ios.md), you could not use Breakpoint. Please consider using a normal proxy.

### 3. Breakpoint with Raw Message

From build 3.1.0, we can modify the Request / Response by using the Raw Message.

\[WIP]

### 4. Breakpoint by the Scripting Tool âœ…&#x20;

If you would like to do Breakpoint in an Automatic way, you should use the [Scripting](../scripting/script.md#1-whats-it) tools, which you can achieve the same result that Breakpoint can do, but in a flexible way by writing Javascript Code.

Please check out this [Snippet Code](../scripting/snippet-code.md#2-common-on-request-and-response) to understand how to use Scripting for Breakpoint.

### 5. Breakpoint with GraphQL Requests

From Proxyman 2.27.0+, Breakpoint can work with GraphQL Request by a specific QueryName. Please check out the following GraphQL Document.

{% content-ref url="graphql.md" %}
[graphql.md](graphql.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### 6. How to use

You can simply create a Breakpoint rule by:

1. Right-Click on the Request -> Tools -> Breakpoint
2. Proxyman will open a Breakpoint Window and fill the Matching Rule.&#x20;
3. Select Breakpoint on Request or Response or both.
4. Click Add to create a rule.
5. Try sending a Request again -> Proxyman will open a Breakpoint and you can modify the data.
6. Click on the Execute Button to send a request/response.
