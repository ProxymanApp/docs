# Diff

### 1. What's it?

During using Proxyman, you might face the situation to find the difference between requests and responses. The Diff tool would help you to:

* Diff two Requests or Response, include the URL, Method, Status Code, Headers, and the Text-based body.
* Render as Side-by-Side or Unified.
* Light and Dark Theme.
* Export as a unified file.
* Open the diff by 3rd-party applications, such as FileMerge.
* Highlight and add comments.

2. Right-Click -> Tools -> Add to Diff pool (Or using âŒ˜Y)
