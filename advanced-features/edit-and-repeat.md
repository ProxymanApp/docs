# Edit & Repeat

### 1. What's it?

Edit & Repeat is a handy tool for developers who need to test the Endpoint directly on Proxyman app without making a new request from your browser or client app.

* Rapidly change a **Query**, **Header**, **Body** of the selected request and test the Response from the server
* Easily reproduce the bug from the server with a different set of params.
* Support Form and JSON format.
* Edit by Raw Message
* Review Response data on the Right Panel (Proxyman 3.6.0+).
