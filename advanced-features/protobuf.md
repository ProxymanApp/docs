# Protobuf

### 1. Protocol Buffer

From [Protobuf's Google](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.&#x20;

You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.

Proxyamn is capable of **reading** a Protobuf Binary and parsing to **JSON Format** with given Protobuf File Descriptors.

### 2. Protobuf File Descriptor (\*.desc)

Proxyman requires File Descriptor (\*.desc) to properly parse the Protobuf Data.

There are various ways to get the File Descriptor:

#### 1. Ask your colleagues.&#x20;

If your company is using Protobuf, it's a high chance that your colleagues have already had this file, especially the Backend and Frontend teams.

It might be one or multiple descriptor files.&#x20;

#### 2. Generate from \*.proto file

If you have a bunch of \*.proto files, you can simply generate 1 single \*.desc file by using the following command line.

```bash
# Install protobuf cli if need
brew install protobuf

# Create `input` folder on the Desktop
# Copy all proto files to the `input` folder

# Generate 1 descriptor file with multiple proto files
protoc --descriptor_set_out=output.desc --include_imports -I=/Users/<your_name>/Desktop/input /Users/<your_name>/Desktop/input/*.proto

# Done
# output.desc
```

Once you have the Descriptor File, you can import them to Proxyman:

* Proxyman -> Tools Menu -> Protobuf Schema&#x20;
* Click on the + button and select the **output.desc** file

{% hint style="info" %}
Proxyman 3.6.0+ only accepts **File Descriptor (\*.desc)** for better Protobuf parsing.

If you have **\*.proto** files, you can convert them to **\*.desc**. Please check out the next section.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Proxyman automatically imports all common types from **Google Protobuf**, such as Timestamp, Struct, Value, Enum, Method, etc.

Proxyman supports both **proto2** and **proto3** syntax. [Read more](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)
{% endhint %}

### 3. Protobuf Config

Before using Protobuf, you have to config which Message Type should be used to parse the Protobuf data.

The following table describes which config are:

| Name                                | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schema                              | Add `.desc` file if need                                                                                                                                             |
| Message Type                        | The Class name of the root object in Protobuf binary. **Must include Package name**                                                                                  |
| Payload Type: **Auto**              | Auto detect if the Protobuf Binary is encoding as a Single Message or [Delimited Message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/techniques#streaming)  |
| Payload Type: **Single Message**    | Single Mesage in a Protobuf Binary                                                                                                                                   |
| Payload Type: **Delimited Message** | Multiple Messages in a Protobuf Binary (Length-Prefix)                                                                                                               |

### 4. How to use?

There are **two** ways to parse Protobuf properly with qualified name fields:

* Define Protobuf Rules
* Read from Content-Type Header

#### 4.1 Define Protobuf Rule

1. Make a request, which has `Content-Type: application/x-protobuf` or `Content-Type: application/protobuf`
2. You can see the Warning that Proxyman couldn't parse properly due to the absence of Message Type. Click Add to open Protobuf Settings

![Missing Message Type](../.gitbook/assets/Screen\_Shot\_2020-04-25\_at\_21\_56\_19.png)

3\. Add Schema and fill Message type and Payload Type:

* Right Click on the Protobuf Request -> Tools -> Protobuf
* Select which Message Type for this request (Add Desc file if need)

4\. Click Add and see qualified JSON Format

#### 4.2 Read from Content-Type Header

You can **dynamically** provide the Protobuf Config from `Content-Type`

For example: Your `Content-Type` in the Request or Response might look like:

`Content-Type: application/x-protobuf; messageType="tutorial.Address"; delimited=true`

`Content-Type: application/x-protobuf; messageType="com.proxyman.User"; delimited=false`

To specify that the Protobuf Body this MessageType and the payload encoding.

### 5. Troubleshooting

#### 5.1 Some name fields are missing

There is a situation where some field names are absent because the field name definition is not included in your Protobuf File Descriptor. It might be your descriptor is out of date.

**Solution**:

* Remove old Protobuf Schema and Add the latest descriptor file from your server.
* If you're using Proxyman 3.5.2 and older, please update to Proxyman 3.6.0 or later. Then, use File Descriptor (\*.desc) for better results.
