# Allow List

### 1. What's it?

Allow List Tool is a handy tool to help you define what domains that you **allow to appear** on Proxyman app.&#x20;

The unmatched requests won't go through Proxyman (by-pass)

It's useful in following situations:

* Ignore all domains except your debugging domains (ex: producthunt.com)
* Reduce the number of unnecessary requests, and focus on domains you need to track

If you would like to block certain domains, please visit [Block Tool](blacklist.md)
