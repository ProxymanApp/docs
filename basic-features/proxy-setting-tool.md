# Proxyman Proxy Helper Tool

## Proxyman Proxy Helper Tool

By default, Proxyman will try overriding your HTTP/HTTPS Proxy Config by using the [networksetup](https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/8/networksetup/) Command-Line. However, the **networksetup** is a bottleneck during starting or quitting the app.&#x20;

Proxyman offers a better solution: **Proxyman Proxy Helper Tool**, which is a [Privileged Helper Tool macOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide/Articles/AccessControl.html#//apple\_ref/doc/uid/TP40002589-SW2) in order to override Network Proxy in **high performance**.[ ](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide/Articles/AccessControl.html#//apple\_ref/doc/uid/TP40002589-SW2)

{% hint style="info" %}
You can notice the performance difference by starting the app with or without the Proxy Setting Tool.

At the first launch, Proxyman will present the Popup to install the Proxyman Proxy Helper Tool. You can skip it and install it later in **Preference** -> **Advanced** Tab.

{% hint style="info" %}
After the installation, you can find the Helper tool at `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.proxyman.NSProxy.HelperTool`

If Proxyman releases a new update for Proxy Setting Helper Tool, it requires installation again.

### Require user Permission for macOS 13 Ventura or later

MacOS Ventura or later requires permission to work properly.

### Guest or non-admin users

If you're a guest or non-admin user, the `networksetup` CLI would fail and could not change the HTTP/HTTPS Proxy config until you install the Proxyman Proxy Helper Tool.&#x20;

Proxyman Proxy Helper Tool has privileged permission to override the proxy config for all kinds of users.

We highly recommend installing the Proxyman Helper Tool if you're a guest or non-admin user to make the UX smoother.

### Uninstall the Proxy Helper Tool

You can uninstall the Proxy Helper Tool in **Preference** -> **Advanced** Tab -> **Uninstall** Proxy Setting Tool or delete it directly at `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.proxyman.NSProxy.HelperTool`

## Install the Proxy Helper Tool by command line

From macOS 4.12.0 or later, you can install the Helper Tool without GUI.

```
sudo /Applications/Proxyman.app/Contents/MacOS/proxyman --install-privileged-components
```

There is an ongoing discussion on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/1583914093437935616?s=46\&t=C1XB91IkDFkG697Ab8T9Dg) that macOS should fix it.
{% endhint %}

After installing the 1.4.0, the Login Item might not be updated due to the cache layer of the Preference.&#x20;
