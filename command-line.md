# Command-line

Proxyman provides a useful command-line tool to enhance your onboarding experience âœ….

You can access the tool at `/Applications/Proxyman.app/Contents/MacOS/proxyman-cli`

### 1. Export Proxyman config

Export all debugging tools rules, such as SSL Proxying List, Breakpoint, Map Local, Scripting, Block List, Allow List, Reverse Proxy, and Network Conditions.

```bash
$ /Applications/Proxyman.app/Contents/MacOS/proxyman-cli export -h

OVERVIEW: Export all debugging tools rules (Breakpoint, SSL Pinning, Map Local, Map
Remote, Scripting, etc).

USAGE: proxyman-cli export [--mode <mode>] --output <output>

OPTIONS:
  -m, --mode <mode>       Export Mode (all = "All debugging tools's rules", enabledRules
                          = "Only enabled rules"). (default: all)
  -o, --output <output>   A Output file to save the config to.
  --version               Show the version.
  -h, --help              Show help information.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, the `export` command would export all rules. To exclude particular rules, please uncheck the "Enabled" column in each debugging tool and use the `-m  enabledRules`
{% endhint %}

#### For example:

* Export all debugging tool rules:

`$ /Applications/Proxyman.app/Contents/MacOS/proxyman-cli export -o ~/Desktop/data.json`

* Only export enabled rules:

`$ /Applications/Proxyman.app/Contents/MacOS/proxyman-cli export -m enabledRules -o ~/Desktop/data.json`

### 2. Import Proxyman config

Import Proxyman debugging tools rules that you have exported by the export command.

```bash
$ /Applications/Proxyman.app/Contents/MacOS/proxyman-cli import -h

OVERVIEW: Import config to Proxyman.

USAGE: proxyman-cli import [--mode <mode>] --input <input>

OPTIONS:
  -m, --mode <mode>       Import Mode (append = "Append to the existing rules"),
                          override = "Import and Replace all existing rules". (default:
                          append)
  -i, --input <input>     A input file to import.
  --version               Show the version.
  -h, --help              Show help information.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, new imported rules will be appended to the existing debugging rules. To override all rules, let use `-m override`
{% endhint %}

#### For example:

* Import all debugging rules by appending them:

`$ /Applications/Proxyman.app/Contents/MacOS/proxyman-cli import -i ~/Desktop/data.json`

* Import, but override all my existing rules:

`$ /Applications/Proxyman.app/Contents/MacOS/proxyman-cli import -m override -i ~/Desktop/data.json`
