  Android devices/simulators
---

# React Native

## 1. React Native - iOS

* If you're using React Native for the iOS app, you can simply follow the iOS Guidelines. There is no difference from the iOS native app.
* Works with Expo or Metro bundler

{% content-ref url="ios-device.md" %}
[ios-device.md](ios-device.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="ios-simulator.md" %}
[ios-simulator.md](ios-simulator.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## 2. React Native - Android

Basically, To capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic from React Native for Android apps, it's similar to the native Android app. Please follow the Android Setup Guide:

* [Android Physical Device](android-device/)
* [Android Emulator](react-native.md#android-emulator)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you've followed all steps in the Guideline, especially the **5th step**, where you add the **res/xml/network\_security\_config.xml** and **AndroidManifest.xml**

Otherwise, Proxyman could not decrypt the SSL connection.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Troubleshooting - Android

### 3.1 Metro bundle errors

After setting the HTTP Proxy from your Android to Proxyman, you might encounter the following error because Metro Bundle could not connect to its local server.

To fix it:

#### Android Emulator

1. Open Proxyman -> Certificate menu -> Install for Android -> Emulator -> Click on the "Revert the Proxy"
2. Open Android Emulator -> Setting App -> Network -> Wifi -> Find a way to change the proxy
3. Change the HTTP Proxy manually by using the **Proxyman IP & Port**. If you don't know what the IP & Port is, open the Certificate menu -> Install for Android -> Physical Device -> In the 2nd section. Find the Server IP & Port.
4. Before saving, enter the `localhost` in the bypass Proxy List ✅

5. Done
6. `The Bridge Was shutdown` warning and the metro bundle errors are gone ✅

#### Android Physical Device

1. Open Android Physical Device -> Setting App -> Network -> Wifi -> Find a way to change the proxy
2. Change the HTTP Proxy manually by using the Proxyman IP & Port. If you don't know what the IP & Port is, open the Certificate menu -> Install for Android -> Physical Device -> In the 2nd section. Find the Server IP & Port.
3. Before saving, enter them `your IP` in the bypass Proxy List ✅&#x20;
4. Done
