# \*.local requests do not appear on Proxyman

### 1. Problem

* All requests are presented on Proxyman properly, except for some local requests (`*.local` or `localhost`)

### 2. Solution

* If it's `localhost` request, please read the following pages

{% content-ref url="couldnt-see-any-request-from-localhost-server.md" %}
[couldnt-see-any-request-from-localhost-server.md](couldnt-see-any-request-from-localhost-server.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* If it's `*.local` request:

Open **System Preference** -> **Network** -> **Wifi** -> **Proxies** tab -> Remove `*.local` in the Bypass List in both Web Proxy (HTTP) and Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS)
